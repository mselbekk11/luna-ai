# “UX Rescue” — Build a Better Onboarding for a Broken App

## 🧠 Problem Overview

The original onboarding experience suffered from several critical experience problems:

- Users felt **confused after sign-up**, with no clear next step.
- **Forms disappeared without confirmation**, leaving users unsure of what was submitted.
- **Lack of visual feedback or state transitions** made the UI feel broken or unresponsive.
- There was **no guidance, motivation, or orientation** during the flow.

The challenge was to redesign this onboarding into an intuitive, fast, and motivating experience — especially for non-technical users working in complex domains like CPG product reformulation.

## 🎯 How I interpreted the problem

The 4 paint points all pointed towards a bad user experience from the moment they signed up to their initial experience of the dashboard. Logging into a new tool can sometimes be overwhelming with buttons, options, multiple side bars etc… especially for non technical users, so I decided to build out an onboarding sequence, which addresses most of the pain points, doesn’t give the end user too many initial options and also gets them to build out something useful so they immediately use the product and can get familiar with it.

## 🧩 What experience problems you focused on first and why.

The first experience problem:

- “I didn’t know what to do after signing up.”

This was the most important to address first because if the end user doesnt even know what to do once signing up then the other three experience problems do not matter as much. It highligted to me that I wanted to build a trendy onboarding sequence which guided the end user on a simple journey, that immediately gave them confidence and even enjoyment using the product whislt also gaining their trust.

## ⏱️ Time Constraints & Trade-Offs

- I decided not to keep track of the users choices in the onboarding sequence
- I decided to keep the dashboard extremely simple, and really put a lot of the effort into the initial onboarding sequence.
- only one journey apposed to multiple depending on the end users choices

## 🚀 If Given More Time (v2 Ideas)

- Store the users choices in a database and then display the data in the dahsboard.
- Got access to the actual software and emulated the real Luna AI Branding
- Multiple Journeys for the end users depending on their choices
- Added Stripe subscriptions
- Integrate AI into the dashboard

## 🔍 Bonus: UX Issue the Original Team Likely Missed

**No Reinforcement of Progress or Momentum.**  
The original flow likely failed to build a sense of momentum. Users had no feedback on how far they’d progressed or what was coming next. I introduced a visual stepper to make users feel like they were making meaningful progress and could also see how much was left.
